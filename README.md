# Comic-website
personal project: comic website

final update:
i cant make the links work for some reason they all open ch2cover.png looks like i cant use java to make comic websites, i gotta use basic stuff, but i m gonna try wordpress since it keeps popping up in the searches it sounds pretty basic but i hope is not so simple that it looks like a caveman did it. So yeah this website got stuck gotta try and make another comic webiste
notes: 

///-----test comments-----////------

so i couldnt fix the links on the archive (gracias por la zero ayudas stack overflow) so i need to erase the entire thing and make it more "simpler" will tried putting a small archive list in the index with all the pages. Make sure to hide the list in with a button
add event listeners to call specific pages-----/////-------
